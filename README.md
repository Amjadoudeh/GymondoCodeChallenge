## How to make it work

```

```
# Important to Read:

By using iOS 15, the same app will be easier to build and we don't need to install KingFisher since it support Async images. 

The Endpoints are not the best, and many exercises have no images ( when we match the id ).

Looking forward to hearing your feedback!
